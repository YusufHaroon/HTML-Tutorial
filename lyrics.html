            Stop loving me
            I will always love you
            Drop the brush, leave this canvas
            Renoir / Aline
            I will always paint
            Stop painting
            Drop the brush, leave this canvas
            Renoir / Aline

            Scorched colors
            Fiery red, life taken
            A canvas I cannot see
            I close my eyes, the dark remains
            All black, her sorrowed eyes
            Through the gold, her laughter stays
            In every hue, a shard of him
            To love him still, though he's long gone

            Paint love
            Paint life
            Cry in color
            On the canvas, our love remains / fades
            I love you
            Paint love
            Paint life
            Cry in color
            On the canvas, our love remains / fades
            I love you

            Love, dream, cry
            Love, dream, cry
            Verso embraced
            Love, dream, cry
            Love, let go, cry
            Verso erased

            Keep on loving you
            Keep on painting
            Reach out with my hand and beg you
            Come back
            Keep on loving you
            Keep on painting
            Reach out with my hand and beg you
            Come back

            In every shadow, her face
            In every line, her trace
            If our heartbeats play out of time
            My love watches, waits
            In every sparkle, her gentle laugh
            In every hue, her smile
            If our heartbeats play out of time
            My love stays, waits
